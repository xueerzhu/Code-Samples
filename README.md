# Code-Samples

This repo contains code samples from my most recent personal project - Tower Lab. \
\
The scope of this project is - I have worked on it on most days for 2 months before today (Dec 2024). \
\
I understand this project lacks architectural complexity and probably will not have many complex animation, UI screens transitions like an industry professional project. But this is the best code samples I could provide for job search purposes right now. Thank you.
